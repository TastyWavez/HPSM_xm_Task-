# HP Services Manager 9.5 Incident Task module integration
**Note**:  HP Services Manager environments will vary on a case by case basis, this is by no means a one size fits all solution. Any changes required from a configuration perspective will be outlined in this README and noted within the integration files using placeholder text e.g. ```<your-text-here>```
## Overview:
Notify on-call response teams when incident tasks are created. With the HP Service Manager Incident Task integration, on-call members of resolver teams can take direct action on incident tasks in real time from xMatters mobile app,email, SMS and voice notifications. 
Information about the incident task is presented to recipients via multiple communication channels, allowing updates, assignments, or status changes to be actioned remotely. As actions are taken, xMatters updates the tickets with informational annotations to provide a full audit trail.
